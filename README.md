Two app communicating between each other by API<br/>

The part of work which I don't include because of lack of need to create another repository in GitHub and I think that the way is more readable.<br/>So we create new project in Intellij IDEA and name it "spring-api-client"

1.Create configuration class in Spring.<br/>
2.Check correct action of comunication by displaying "hello" in Hello class.<br/>
3.Copy class's model ( in our case it is Computer class).<br/>
4.In Hello class create proper methods to communication with API of another project and serve it(I use mainly as class as : RestTemplate and ResponseEntity and HttpHeader).<br/>
